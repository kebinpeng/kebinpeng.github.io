I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at East Carolina University (2024 - now). My research focuses on 3D computer vision, including areas such as depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, and point cloud detection/segmentation, as well as machine learning.

Before joining ECU, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer (C++) at MathWorks (2023-2024) and previously interned as a Computer Vision Scientist at Samsung Research America.

I earned my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at San Antonio (2019-2023) and my master's degree from Beihang University.
