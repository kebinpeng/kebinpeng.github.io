I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at East Carolina University (2024 - now). Before joining ECU, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer (C++) at MathWorks (2023-2024) and previously interned as a Computer Vision Scientist at Samsung Research America.

I earned my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at San Antonio (2019-2023) and my master's degree from Beihang University.
